# ðŸŽ¨ Portfolio Demos

## Welcome! This repository contains the code for the interactive demos from my personal portfolio. These projects are meant to showcase technical skills, design sensibilities, and creative problem-solving. All demos are self-contained and reflect the kind of frontend experiences I love building.

Youâ€™ll find examples that include:

- Interactive interfaces built with **HTML/CSS/JavaScript and TypeScript/Tailwind**
- **Three.js** and **WebGL** visual experiences
- Micro-apps and animation prototypes
- UX or UI components I've designed and implemented

---

This is a working project and these demos will be refined in the future. To interact with the demos, feel free to clone the repo and run some of them, or you can see them in action on my website here! [LINK]

Thank you for taking the time to check these out, hopefully we'll be in touch soon!

- Mark
